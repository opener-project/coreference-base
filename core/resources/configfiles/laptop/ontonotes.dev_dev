###  This is a configuration file in the format expected by
###  ConfigParser.  Any line beginning with a hash mark (#) is a
###  comment.  Lines beginning with three hash markes are used for
###  general commentary, lines with only one are example configuration
###  settings
###
###  You must set corpus.data_in or fill out the section db
###  and will likely want to change other settings
###
###  Note that fields that take lists (for example banks) want space
###  separated elements.  For example:
###
###    banks: parse prop coref sense
###
###  Also note that all settings in the configuration file may be
###  overridden on the command line if the tool is using
###  on.common.util.load_options as all the tools here do.  The syntax
###  for that is:
###
###    python some_tool -c some_config Section.Option=Value
###
###  For example:
###
###    python load_to_db.py -c config.example corpus.data_in=/corpus/data
###
###  Because we use spaces to separate elements of lists, you may need
###  to put argument values in quotes:
###
###    python load_to_db.py -c config.example corpus.banks="name prop"
###
###  In general, each section here is used by one api function.

[corpus]
###### This section is used by on.ontonotes.__init__ ######
###
###
### data_in: Where to look for the data
###
### this should be a path ending in 'data/'; the root of the ontonotes
### file system heirarchy.

data_in: /home/josubg/remote/conll2011/corpus/dev/auto/data/

### If you set data_in to a specific parse file, as so:
#
# data_in: /path/to/the/data/english/annotations/nw/wsj/00/wsj_0020.parse
#
### Then only that document will be loaded and you can ignore the next
### paragraph on the load variable and leave it unset


### What to load:
###
### There is a heirarchy: lang / genre / source.  We specify what to
### load in the form lang-genre-source, with the final term optional.
###
### The example configuration below loads only the wsj (which is in
### english.nw):

load: english-bc-cctv
#load: english
### Note that specific sources are optional.  To load all the chinese
### broadcast news data, you would set load to:
#
# load: chinese-bn
#
### One can also load multiple sections, for example if one wants to
### work with english and chinese broadcast communications data (half
### of which is parallel):
#
# load: english-bc chinese-bc
#
### This a flexible configuration system, but if it is not
### sufficiently flexible, one option would be to look at the source
### code for on.ontonotes.from_files() to see how to manually and
### precisely select what data is loaded.
###


### One can also load only some individual documents.  The
### configuration values that control this are:
###
###   suffix, and
###   prefix
###
### The default, if none of these are set, is to load all files
### for each loaded source regardless of their four digit id.  This is
### equivalent to the setting either of them to nothing:
#
# prefix:
# suffix:
#
###
### Set them to space separated lists of prefixes and suffixes:
#
# suffix: 6 7 8
# prefix: 00 01 02
#
### The above settings would load all files whose id ends in 6, 7, or
### 8 and whose id starts with 00, 01, or 02.
###


### We can also set the granularity of loading.  A subcorpus is an
### arbitrary collection of documents, that by default will be all the
### documents for one source.  If we want to have finer grained
### divisions, we can.  This means that the code:
###
###    # config has corpus.load=english-nw
###    a_ontonotes = on.ontonotes.from_files(config)
###    print len(a_ontonotes)
###
### Would produce different output for each granularity setting.  If
### granularity=source, english-nw has both wsj and xinhua, so the
### ontonotes object would contain two subcorpus instances and it
### would print "1".  For granularity=section, there are 25 sections
### in the wsj and 4 in xinhua, so we would have each of these as a
### subcorpus instance and print "29".  For granularity=file, there
### are a total of 922 documents in all those sections, so it would
### create 922 subcorpus objects each containing only a single
### document.
###

granularity: source
#granularity: section
#granularity: file

###
### Once we've selected which documents to put in our subcorpus with
### on.ontonotes.from_files, we need to decide which banks to load.
### That is, do we want to load the data in the .prop files?  What
### about the .coref files?
###

banks: parse coref sense name parallel prop speaker
#banks: v2_gold_parse v2_gold_coref v2_gold_sense v2_gold_name v2_gold_parallel v2_gold_prop v2_gold_speaker
### You need not load all the banks:
#
# banks: parse coref sense
# banks: parse
#
###


### The name and sense data included in this distribution is all word
### indexed.  If you want to process different data with different
### indexing (indexing that counts traces) then set these varibles
### apropriately.

wsd-indexing: word
# word | token | nword_vtoken | notoken_vword

name-indexing: word
# word | token

###
### Normally, when you load senses or propositions, the metadata that
### tells you how to interpret them is also loaded.  If you don't wish
### to load these, generally because they are slow to load, you can
### say so here.  A value of "senses" means "don't load the sense
### inventories" and a value of "frames" means "don't load the frame
### files".  One can specify both.
###
### The default value is equivalent to "corpus.ignore_inventories="
### and results in loading both of them as needed.
###
#
# ignore-inventories: senses frames
